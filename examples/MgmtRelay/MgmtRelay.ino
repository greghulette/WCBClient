/*
  MgmtRelay.ino — turn any ESP32 into a WCB management relay
                  (USB serial and/or WiFi ↔ ESP-NOW)

  Flash this to ANY ESP32, plug it into USB, and it becomes a transparent doorway
  into your WCB network. Whatever you (or a host tool like the NaviCore Config
  Tool in "Via WCB" mode) send on USB serial is relayed onto the mesh, and every
  reply from the mesh is printed straight back to USB. That is ALL it does — it
  hosts no servos, audio, LEDs, or PWM; its sole purpose is to be the relay.

  Optionally (RELAY_WIFI_MODE, OFF by default) it carries that exact same line
  protocol over a WebSocket at ws://<ip>/ws — from its own SoftAP, or by joining an
  existing one such as NaviCore's — so a phone or desktop app reaches the whole mesh
  with no USB cable. USB keeps working at the same time: the two are peers, and USB
  stays the fallback when WiFi is misbehaving.

  ── WHY THIS BOARD CARRIES THE WiFi AND THE WCBs DO NOT ───────────────────────
  Putting WiFi on every WCB is the obvious idea and the wrong one. The ESP32 has ONE
  radio: an associated STA follows its AP's channel, so an AP you do not control can
  move a board off the mesh channel and split the network silently, and a STA that
  cannot find its AP rescans across every channel, going deaf to the mesh on each
  sweep. On a WCB that costs real damage too — S3/S4/S5 are bit-banged software
  UARTs whose TX timing is already sensitive to radio interrupt load. Concentrating
  WiFi on ONE board that hosts nothing puts all of that where it costs nothing, and
  gives a host app one address instead of N.

  Use it to:
    • Run the NaviCore Config Tool over a spare ESP32 instead of a real WCB —
      "Via WCB" mode talks to this relay and manages every WCB *and* the NaviCore
      through this one USB port.
    • Fire ad-hoc commands at any board from a plain Serial Monitor.
    • Watch the mesh's JSON telemetry / replies scroll by.

  ── Serial protocol (matches the WCB firmware's own serial port) ───────────────
    ;w<id>,<command>    Relay <command> to WCB <id> over ESP-NOW (unicast).
                        <id> 1–19 = a WCB; 20 = the NaviCore (special peer).
                        Two-digit ids REQUIRE the comma:  ;w20,{"type":"PING"}
    ;w<alias>,<command> Same, but address a board by its advertised WDP alias
                        (e.g. ;wdome,:PP100) — resolved from adverts we've heard.
    <plain text, no ';' prefix>
                        BROADCAST to every board, exactly like typing a bare
                        command into a WCB's serial port. (A bare JSON line —
                        one starting with '{' — is IGNORED; see the note below.)

  ── Changing the WiFi mode without a reflash ──────────────────────────────────
    ?RELAY,WIFI                     report the mode, SSID and address
    ?RELAY,WIFI,OFF                 ESP-NOW only
    ?RELAY,WIFI,AP[,<pass>]         host our own AP (optionally set its password)
    ?RELAY,WIFI,JOIN,<ssid>,<pass>  join an existing AP — NaviCore's, typically
    ?RELAY,WIFI,DEFAULTS            forget NVS, return to the compiled-in values

  The mode and credentials live in NVS, so this survives a reboot and the sketch
  never has to be edited to move a relay between a bench AP and a droid. Each of
  these saves and then REBOOTS (after the console goes quiet) — see the note above
  RELAY_WIFI_MODE for why the change cannot safely be applied to a live radio.
  Passwords can be set but are never printed back: this console is mirrored to
  every connected WebSocket client.

  ── Using it with the NaviCore Config Tool ────────────────────────────────────
  Just Connect. The tool pings for a DIRECT reply first, gets none through the
  relay, and auto-switches to "Via WCB" mode — wrapping every command as
  ;w20,{...} and fragmenting large configs — with no manual toggle. That
  auto-detect is exactly why a bare JSON line is ignored above: relaying raw JSON
  would let the tool latch onto Direct-USB mode, where big configs are sent
  UNFRAGMENTED and would overflow this relay. In "Via WCB" mode everything is
  wrapped as ;w20,{...}, so it flows correctly.

  Inbound: any command/reply a board sends to this relay (or broadcasts) is
  printed to USB verbatim — so a NaviCore JSON reply reaches the Config Tool's
  parser unchanged (the sender's id travels *inside* the JSON). That includes the
  5 Hz rc_ch channel stream, which drives the Config Tool's live joystick / channel
  display; it's low bandwidth and, because every USB write is done from loop() (see
  the RelayLine note), it doesn't flood or corrupt the stream.

  ── Setup ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    1. Fill in the four network credentials below to match your WCB system.
    2. Give this relay a DEVICE_ID no real WCB uses. A high id like the default 19
       is the natural pick — it won't collide with a real board's slot. It's above
       WCB_QUANTITY, so begin() logs a harmless one-line WARNING; that's fine — the
       NaviCore/WCBs register this relay to reply the moment it first talks to them
       (needs WCB_Client 1.9.6+), and it also advertises over WDP so they remember
       it across reboots.
    2b. Set WCB_QUANTITY to your real number of WCBs. The relay pre-registers those
       (1..WCB_QUANTITY), so ;w<id>, reaches each of them right away; boards above
       that number are reached once the relay auto-joins them from their adverts.
    3. To talk to the NaviCore, the WCBs must have the special peer enabled:
       ?SPECIAL,ON,20  (and the NaviCore must be at that id — 20 by default).
    4. Flash to any ESP32 — no wiring, everything is wireless.
    5. OPTIONAL, for WiFi access: set RELAY_WIFI_MODE and fill in the credentials
       in the block below. MESH_CHANNEL must match every WCB (?WCBCH) — one radio
       means the AP and the mesh share a channel, and a mismatch is a silent
       blackout, not an error. The AP password is mandatory (>= 8 chars): this
       WebSocket relays ";w<id>,<cmd>" to every board with no credential of its
       own, so an open AP would hand the droid to anyone in range.

  ── WebSocket protocol (RELAY_WIFI_MODE != OFF) ───────────────────────────────
    ADDRESS: with RELAY_STATIC_IP (on by default) this relay is always at
             192.168.4.<DEVICE_ID> — 192.168.4.19 out of the box — whether it is
             hosting the AP itself or has joined NaviCore's. The app therefore needs
             no discovery and does not care which of the two happened. Needs
             DEVICE_ID >= 13; lower ids fall inside the AP's DHCP pool and the build
             refuses them rather than letting it fail in the field.

    ws://192.168.4.19/ws
                   Newline-delimited UTF-8. Lines are EXACTLY what you would type
                   on the USB port above (";w3,:PP100", or bare text to broadcast),
                   because both mouths feed the same relaySerialLine(). A line may
                   span several frames; frames are reassembled per socket.
    Replies are a CONSOLE MIRROR, not strict request/response: everything the relay
    would print to USB — command replies, board online/offline, mesh telemetry — is
    streamed to every connected client.

    This is deliberately the same transport NaviCore exposes (its docs/PROTOCOLS.md;
    same URI, same framing, same mirror semantics), so a host app writes ONE client
    and points it at either box. Only the payload grammar differs: NaviCore speaks
    JSON verbs, this speaks the WCB serial grammar.

//
// The credentials are NVS-backed for the same reason: they were compile-time

//
// On a shared power switch this relay and NaviCore boot together, and the relay wins
// that race every time: its setup() is a few queues and wcb.begin(), while NaviCore
// raises its SoftAP only at the END of its own setup — after mounting LittleFS,
// loading config, and allocating a ~3.1 MB PSRAM record buffer. A one-shot wait in
// setup() therefore expires against an AP that had simply not appeared yet, and the
// fallback then leaves TWO APs up with the app on the wrong one. That is worse than
// no AP at all, and it would be the COMMON case, not the edge case. So we keep
// retrying for JOIN_GIVEUP_MS with the mesh fully alive throughout, and only host our
// own AP if the other one genuinely never shows.
//
// Two things make an association dangerous to a mesh device. Both are handled here
// rather than hoped away:
//
//   SCANNING  A WiFi.begin() with no channel probes EVERY channel looking for the
//             SSID, and for the length of each sweep this board is off the mesh.
//             Passing MESH_CHANNEL confines the probe to the one channel we are
//             already on, which is what makes retrying cheap enough to do at all;
//             auto-reconnect stays OFF so a vanished AP cannot start its own sweeps.

//   ?MGMT,FRAG,<targetWCB>,<sessionHex>,<chunkIdx>,<totalChunks>,<payload>
// Each FRAG is forwarded to the target EXACTLY like the WCB firmware relay
// (WCB.ino handleMgmtFrag ~2394-2426), so a real WCB and this relay are interchangeable:
//   • single-chunk (totalChunks==1): one ETM unicast with a '\x01' (SOH) wizard-origin
//     marker prepended, so the target resets lastReceivedViaESPNOW and the relayed
//     command propagates just like a locally-typed one (Push-small / Test / IDENTIFY /
//     WLED / VAR / sequence-test / remote-terminal start-stop-keystrokes).
//   • multi-chunk (a big config Push): each chunk is forwarded VERBATIM as a raw type-3
//     wcb_packet_mgmt_t (WCB_MGMT_PACKET_TYPE_FRAG); the TARGET reassembles per session
//     and runs it. So there is NO relay-side reassembly, no relay-side size cap, and the
//     target keeps wizard-origin (fan-out) semantics. (wcb.send() must NOT be used for
//     multi-chunk: it caps at WCB_MGMT_MAX_COMMAND_LEN and fragments as type-5 UNICAST,
//     which silently drops oversized configs and loses fan-out.)
//
// Phase 2b: ?MGMT,PULL / STATS / ETM,CHAR + the remote-terminal OUTPUT stream. These need
// firmware ESP-NOW structs that WCB_Client does NOT expose, so they are replicated here
// byte-for-byte. Flow: the relay unicasts a 43-byte config-request to the target; the target
// broadcasts back 230-byte config-fragments (config / stats / etm — distinguished by
// packetType) which we reassemble per session and print as [MGMT:CONFIG|STATS|ETM,<src>]<data>;
// a target running a remote terminal unicasts 204-byte remote-term packets which we print as
// [TERM:<src>]<line>. The raw receive callback runs on the WiFi task, so it ONLY copies the
// packet into a queue — all decode/reassembly/Serial output happens in loop() (single writer).
